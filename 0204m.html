<main id="introduction">

    <p>Animals are a major group of organisms, classified as the kingdom Animalia or Metazoa.
        In general they are multicellular, capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment, and feed by consuming other organisms. Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things.
    <br> The biggest difference between humans and animals is that humans are driven by reason and logic. They can engage in intellectual activities.
        Animals, on the other hand, are completely driven by instincts.</p>

<p>A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal</p>

    <p>famouse types of pets are</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Rabbit</li>
    <li>Parrot</li>
    <li>Fish</li>
    </ul>

    <dl>
        <dt>Dogs</dt>
        <dd>some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work.
            They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans.
            Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around humans<br>

        <dt>Cats</dt>
        <dd>Cats make affectionate and playful pets and thrive best when they're cared for considering their dietary, environmental and health and welfare needs
            cats are relatively low maintenance compared to dogs which need companionship, walking, training etc.
            However, like any pet, they do need care, and some cats need more care than others.<br>
